The stakeholder profiles describe different categories of customers and other key stakeholders
for the project. You needn’t describe every stakeholder group, such as legal staff who must check
for compliance with pertinent laws on a website development project. Focus on different types
of customers, target market segments, and the various user classes within those segments. Each
stakeholder profile should include the following information:
- The major value or benefit that the stakeholder will receive from the product. Stakeholder
value could be defined in terms of:
• Improved productivity.
• Reduced rework and waste.
• Cost savings.
• Streamlined business processes.
• Automation of previously manual tasks.
• Ability to perform entirely new tasks.
• Compliance with pertinent standards or regulations.

- Constraint: A limiting factor within which the project manager must operate
- Driver: A significant success objective with limited flexibility for adjustment
